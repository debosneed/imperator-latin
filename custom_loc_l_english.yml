He talked to the youngsters living in the city, asking them questions about every single topic he could think of.\n\nGrowing a small following of his own, people started to look to him for guidance in their life, writing down his words and ideas. Supposedly an oracle even claimed that he was the wisest man there was.\n\nAs his city started to deteriorate, he was partly blamed for misleading the youth, and was forced to end his life with poison."
