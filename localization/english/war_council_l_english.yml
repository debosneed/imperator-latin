[SCOPE.sChar('guard').GetPraenomen] obstinately continues to promote [SCOPE.sChar('guard').GetHerHis] own agenda, insisting that [SCOPE.sC('target_country_2').GetName] is ripe for conquest, citing [SCOPE.sChar('guard').GetHerHis] large network of informants in the [SCOPE.sC('target_country_2').GetAdjective] countryside."
 war_council_2_and_3_agree:0 "\n\nAs promising and flawed arguments are proffered on all sides, the status-quo descends eventually.
