 ip_republic.46.desc:0 "On [GetDateString], the high-ranking [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [GetOffice('office_censor').GetCulturalName(ROOT.GetCountry)], [SCOPE.sChar('prominent_lawmaker').GetName] was brutally murdered in [SCOPE.sChar('prominent_lawmaker').GetHerHis] home after an important senatorial debate.\n\n[SCOPE.sChar('prominent_lawmaker').GetPraenomen] had been a fierce advocate for the rights of foreign minorities in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], going so far as to propose the formal extension of citizenship to all free men within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] borders. This rhetoric angered many conservative senators, who were desperate to conserve the ancient status quo.\n\nWith no clear successor to the ideology of [SCOPE.sChar('prominent_lawmaker').GetPraenomen], [SCOPE.sChar('prominent_lawmaker').GetHerHis] movement, widely popular amongst the lower classes, has ground to a halt. With growing unrest amongst far-flung provinces, the Senate is expected to make a statement."

 ip_republic.47.desc:0 "In uproar at our inability to address concerns over the [SCOPE.sChar('prominent_lawmaker').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] Reforms, the senate has formally called upon the aid of troops loyal to the spirit of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Messengers were sent, in the dead of night, to all generals; in the hope that they would rally troops and march against the tyranny of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].\n\nIt seems many have answered the call - let us show them how we deal with traitors."
 ip_republic.47.a:0 "Their treachery shall be repaid in full."
 ip_republic.48.t:0 "Senate Issues Ultimatum"
 ip_republic.48.desc:0 "On behalf of a large senate majority, [SCOPE.sChar('ultimatum_protagonist').GetName] has delivered an ultimatum, demanding the immediate revocation of all bills passed during our recent sitting on the legislation informally known as the [SCOPE.sChar('prominent_lawmaker').GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] Reforms.\n\nIn addition to the revocation, the rebellious parties have demanded the re-institution of various land tithes which were abolished many centuries ago. [SCOPE.sChar('ultimatum_protagonist').GetPraenomen] ended [SCOPE.sChar('ultimatum_protagonist').GetHerHis] monologue with a worrisome reference to the support of not only senators, but much of our military hierarchy as well."
 ip_republic.48.a:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has survived worse threats than [SCOPE.sChar('ultimatum_protagonist').GetPraenomen] and [SCOPE.sChar('ultimatum_protagonist').GetHerHis] blatant hyperbole."
