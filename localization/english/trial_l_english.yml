It seems that whilst drawing up details of the accusation, our examiners had neglected to check the whereabouts of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] on the eve of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetHerHis] supposed criminal activity - [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] was in fact visiting [SCOPE.sC('alibi_country').GetName] on a diplomatic mission."

It appears that [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetSheHe] is now vouched for by [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetPraenomen] of the [SCOPE.sChar('powerful_ally').GetFamilyDisplayName] family.
