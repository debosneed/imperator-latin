The enemy flee in disgrace, and all that is left is to decide on how to treat the residents within.\n\nNeedless to say, the spoils of war are likely to cause those back in [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetEmployer.GetCapital.GetName] to admire [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetPraenomen] greatly, but leaving such wealth in the hands of one [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetWomanMan] could cause problems in future..."

The wealth that [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetPraenomen] has gained from this evil act is beyond compare, and our advisors suggest that [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetSheHe] is now one of the richest people in our land. Even deserters previously resident in [SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName] are flocking to join [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetPraenomen].\n\nDespite [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetHerHis] popular acclaim, we should consider punishing [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetHerHim] for these dastardly actions."

 returning_merc_siege_no:0 "Sadly, few stories were heard of [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen], during [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis] times away - indeed, few even recognized [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHim] upon [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis] appearance at the [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_court_type')], however, [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen] assures us of the newfound tenacity of [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetHerHis] resolve.\n\n"

Upon crossing the border, [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetSheHe] issued a stark proclamation in support of the vile pretender, [SCOPE.sChar('supported_pretender').GetName].\n\nLet us hope that we are able to soothe the mind of [SCOPE.sChar('returning_merc').GetPraenomen] with honeyed words, or better still: gold."

Fearing an ambush, he signals his loyal men, who fan out into a defensive formation with consummate discipline.\n\nThen - another sound - this time from behind.\n\n'What's that?', he cries..."
