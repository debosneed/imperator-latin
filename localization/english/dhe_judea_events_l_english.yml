 dhe_judea.1.t:0 "The Religion of Judea"
 dhe_judea.1.desc:1 "The province of Judea is home to the Jewish religion; an unusually dogmatic faith which claims there is but one god named Yahweh. Their priests spread prophesies that his followers will one day retake Judea - a land promised to them by this god himself - from foreign invaders, and establish an immortal Jewish state. These delusions have created a long history of separatism in the region, and they doggedly resist all attempts to integrate their religion peacefully.\n\nIn order to end their obstinacy, and preemptively quell any future rebellion, it has been suggested that we outlaw Jewish religious practices and re-purpose their temples to the worship of [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] gods once and for all."
 dhe_judea.1.a:0 "Raid their temples, and outlaw their god."
 dhe_judea.1_1at:0 "Some Jews in Judea will be forcibly converted and all provinces in Judea will get #Y Judaism Outlawed#! for 10 years, giving the effects:\nLocal Unrest: #R +2.00#!\nLocal Tax: #R -20.00%#!\nWrong Culture-Group Happiness: #R -15.00%#!"
 dhe_judea.1_2at:0 "If the Jewish faith remains dominant in Judea a revolt will occur."
 dhe_judea.1.b:0 "Everything is fine as it is."
 dhe_judea.1.bt:0 "The matter will not be settled."
 dhe_judea.1.c:0 "Just grant them their kingdom."
 dhe_judea.1.ct:0 "Judea will be released as a #Y client state#! of [SCOPE.sC('dhe_judea_owner_scope').GetName] and any Judean characters in [SCOPE.sC('dhe_judea_owner_scope').GetName] will return to Judea."
 dhe_judea.2.t:0 "Conversions in [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]"
 dhe_judea.2.desc:0 "Our forceful conversion policies have seen success in the province of [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]. Influential so called [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName] Jews have been spreading the argument that relaxing the stricter rules of their religion and integrating into the society of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is the best outcome for the Jewish people both as individuals and as a whole.\n\nWith a little encouragement, we could surely encourage further sincere conversions by supporting this movement, at the risk of provoking unrest."
 dhe_judea.2.a:0 "The [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] gods are best."
 dhe_judea.2.b:0 "We want all of them, or none of them."
 dhe_judea.3.t:0 "Jewish Resurgence in [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]"
 dhe_judea.3.desc:0 "It seems that despite our best attempts, there are many who still hold the Jewish faith in the privacy of their homes. Worse still, Jewish priests in [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName] have been openly protesting the decision to outlaw their religion, inspiring public reconversion and affirmations of loyalty to the Jewish faith.\n\nThe movement has been gaining momentum, and will require a robust response to reverse, and of course will even further upset the local population."
 dhe_judea.3.a:0 "This is harder than we thought..."
 dhe_judea.3.b:0 "Redouble our efforts!"
 dhe_judea.4.t:0 "Looting Across [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]"
 dhe_judea.4.desc:0 "[SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName] has seen widespread discontent since Judaism was outlawed. Over a few days, peaceful demonstrations through the forum have escalated into violent attacks on government buildings and ambushes on the town watch.\n\nTrade has all but ground to a halt as radical Jewish dissidents extort and threaten the local populace into maintaining their faith and undermining [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] by any means."
 dhe_judea.4.a:0 "Let them gnash their teeth."
 dhe_judea.4.b:0 "Restore order and deal with the perpetrators."
 dhe_judea.4.bt:0 "Any remaining Jewish Pops in #Y [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]#! will convert."
 dhe_judea.5.t:0 "Jewish Attacks in [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]"
 dhe_judea.5.desc:0 "The province of [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName] has seen a wave of unrest in response to the expulsion of Jewish priests and the erection of statues of [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] gods in their places of worship.\n\nIt seems that a radical Jewish priest reacted to our policies by publicly murdering a [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] Jew during a religious ceremony, sparking a wave of similar attacks locally and ultimately the flight or murder of many sympathetic Jews in [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]. The priest has since disappeared along with his family and followers.\n\nThese radicals seem to think they can get away with heinous anarchy."
 dhe_judea.5.a:0 "There is no use crying over spilled milk."
 dhe_judea.5.b:0 "Restore order and force the territory to convert."
 dhe_judea.5.bt:0 "Any remaining Jewish Pops in #Y [SCOPE.sP('dhe_judea_target_province_scope').GetName]#! will convert."
 dhe_judea.6.t:0 "Revolt of the Maccabees "
 dhe_judea.6.desc_1:1 "Unrest has been growing throughout Judea, and the majority of Jewish followers have refused to adopt the [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] gods despite our efforts to outlaw their religion.\n\nA man named [SCOPE.sChar('dhe_judea_maccabee_character_scope').GetName] has appeared at the head of a major Jewish rebellion, claiming to be the son of a priest who murdered a [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] Jew before fleeing. His followers have given him the epithet Makabi, the Hammer, supposedly in recognition for his leadership in the unrest across Judea.\n\nOur plans to bring lasting peace to the province have backfired, and at this point our only options are to fight these "Maccabees" or grant the Jews their wish of an independent state."
 dhe_judea.6.desc_2:1 "Our decision to leave the question of Jewish separatism open seems to have backfired. Unhappy with being governed by foreign "Gentiles", radical Jewish separatists have clandestinely organized a major revolt.\n\nA man named [SCOPE.sChar('dhe_judea_maccabee_character_scope').GetName] has appeared at the movement's head, claiming to be the son of a priest who murdered a [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] Jew before fleeing. His followers have given him the epithet Makabi, the Hammer, supposedly in recognition for his leadership.\n\nAt this point our only options are to fight these "Maccabees" or grant them Judea as a client state and hope that they are satisfied."
 dhe_judea.6.a:0 "We can handle them."
 dhe_judea.6.at:0 "All provinces in Judea will get #Y Maccabee Revolt#! for 25 years, giving the effects:\nLocal Unrest: #R +5.00#!\nLocal Tax: #R -50.00%#!\nWrong Culture-Group Happiness: #R -50.00%#!\n"
 dhe_judea.6.b:0 "Grant them their wish."
 dhe_judea.6.bt:0 "Judea will be released as a #Y client state#! and any Judean characters in [SCOPE.sC('dhe_judea_owner_scope').GetName] will return to Judea."
 dhe_judea.6.c:0 "We are stretched too thin as it is."
 dhe_judea.6.ct:0 "#Y Judea#! will become #Y independent#! and any Judean characters in [SCOPE.sC('dhe_judea_owner_scope').GetName] will return to Judea."
 dhe_judea.7.t:0 "Free Once More"
 dhe_judea.7.desc_1:1 "The kingdom of Judea, bastion of the Jewish faith, has at last regained its independence, albeit as a tributary. The temple in Jerusalem has been cleansed and re-dedicated to Yahweh, and the pagan idols smashed in the forum. This day will be celebrated every year for all time with the lighting of candles, lest we forget the struggles of our people.\n\nThis is a new start for our people, and we must decide how we will treat with our neighbors, and what the focus of our state should be."

 dhe_judea.8.t:0 "Peace in Judea"
 dhe_judea.8.desc_1:1 "Reports from the province of Judea seem to indicate that the insurrection of radical Jews has fizzled out since the integration of many Jews into the [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] religion. Our heavy handed tactics have successfully transformed a region with centuries of separatist tradition into merely a diverse province, comparable with any other in [ROOT.Country.GetName]."
 dhe_judea.8.desc_2:0 "Reports from the province of Judea seem to indicate that the underground separatist movements in Judea have fizzled out since the integration of many Jews into the [ROOT.Country.GetReligion.GetName] religion. A mixture of luck and conversions have successfully transformed a region with centuries of separatist tradition into merely a diverse province, comparable with any other in [ROOT.Country.GetName]."
 dhe_judea.8.a:0 "All is well, that ends well."
 dhe_judea.8.at:0 "All #Y Hebrew#! Pops in Judea will return to #Y Judaism#!."
 dhe_judea.8.b:0 "And to think we were afraid of the "People of Judea's Front"."
 dhe_judea.8.bt:0 "All #Y Hebrew#! Pops in Judea will return to #Y Judaism#!."
