 dhe_body.5.desc:0 "After the recent conquest of [SCOPE.sP('body_province').GetName], our warriors spent much time prowling the streets for spoils.\n\nDuring this predatory but tolerated activity, one of our loyal officers reported coming across a sombre edifice shrouded in an atmosphere of majesty, the likes of which he had never before experienced. On closer inspection, this mighty building contained naught but a single sarcophagus, which the we believe belonged to [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_knowledge_of_alexander')]. [SCOPE.sP('body_province').Custom('why_is_there_a_body_here')]\n\nPossessing the tomb of this great warrior is bound to bring us great prestige, not to mention the jealousy of our peers.

In it, lies the body of the most revered of men: Alexander. His victories almost innumerable, this man had a vision the likes of which has not been seen since. [SCOPE.sP('body_province').Custom('why_is_there_a_body_here')]\n\nSuch a man deserves to be left in peace for his eternal slumber, but various voices in our armies cry out for differing treatment of the remains of this hero, once feared and admired in equal measure."
