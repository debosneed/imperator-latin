Several minor scholars from the local area has come to offer their service, though [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_advisor').GetName] recommend that we search for some foreigners to put forward their views on the matter of academics also.\n\nAfter a lot of searching, they have come up with three good alternatives: [SCOPE.sCharacter('scholar_character').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('scholar_character').GetEmployer.GetName], [SCOPE.sCharacter('scholar_character_2').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('scholar_character_2').GetEmployer.GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('scholar_character_3').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('scholar_character_3').GetEmployer.GetName]."

 dhe_museion.3.t:0 "Scrolls for a Muse"
 dhe_museion.3.desc:1 "We have sent out envoys to the whole known world to gather together all the scrolls, texts and tablets we can find, to fill our upcoming Mouseion. Our scholars have found a particular interesting copy of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_random_ancient_text')] in [SCOPE.sCountry('randomized_country').GetName], though it would cost us a significant amount of funds to back this endeavor.\n\nOur scholars assure us this is necessary to complete our collection, and it would benefit our research greatly."
 dhe_museion.3.a:0 "Even more texts? This is getting ridiculous."
 dhe_museion.3.b:0 "Our nation for a Muse."
 dhe_museion.4.t:1 "A Poetic Muse for the Mouseion"
 dhe_museion.4.desc:1 "What would a temple to the Muses be without poets to fill it? We have had a lot of lesser known poets and writers take part in the work that has been done to build the Mouseion into a proper temple of knowledge, but we still lack someone who has the right characteristics.\n\nAfter a long search, we have found two worthwhile candidates in [SCOPE.sCharacter('poet_character').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('poet_character').GetEmployer.GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('poet_character_2').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('poet_character_2').GetEmployer.GetName]. Though the Mouseion might not be big enough for the both of them, so we should send an invitation to one of them for now."
 dhe_museion.4.a:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('poet_character').GetName] seems interesting."
 dhe_museion.4.b:0 "We have heard [SCOPE.sCharacter('poet_character_2').GetName] is good at [SCOPE.sCharacter('poet_character_2').GetHerHis] job."

 dhe_museion.10.t:1 "The Mouseion Begins"
 dhe_museion.10.desc:1 "We have sent out scholars and envoys to every corner of the world, to find texts, sources and codices to fill the great Mouseion. It will truly be the center of all our knowledge, and at the forefront of cultural life among the Hellenics.\n\nIt will be proven once and for all that Alexandria is truly one of the greatest cities, no matter if one looks for culture, technology or knowledge. This will be memorialized as the moment when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] became one of the great nations in the world."
 dhe_museion.10.a:0 "This will be a temple to be remembered."
 dhe_museion.11.t:1 "The Mouseion"
 dhe_museion.11.desc:1 "The work on the Mouseion is finally complete, and the great majestic building is one that will be forever remembered, as will our rule. Academics, scholars, poets, writers and musicians from all across the known world has gathered together at the doorstep of Alexandria to share their knowledge and skills, to the great benefit of our people.\n\nWith all these people gathered under our fold, Alexandria has truly become the gem of our nation. All that remains is to find a direction for all of this potential."

 dhe_museion.12.desc:1 "In the middle of the chaos as Alexandria is besieged by enemies, the night sky is lit up by a massive blaze. All of the Mouseion is on fire, buildings with scrolls, texts and all. Few have the time to react to this tragedy, before it is too late to save the building, much less what is kept inside.\n\nThis can only be considered a massive tragedy to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people, as the memory of our once great Temple is all that is left."
 dhe_museion.12.a:0 "How could this happen?"
 dhe_museion.20.t:0 "Filling the Library"
 dhe_museion.20.desc:1 "As we continue to try and keep the Mouseion up to date on all the latest writings and ideas, we have come across a couple of texts that might be of interest to us.\n\nOne of them is a copy of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_random_ancient_text')] we have been trying to collect for quite a while, whereas the other one is [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_random_ancient_text_keyword')] [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_random_ancient_text')], a rare and valuable text."
 dhe_museion.20.a:0 "Our original goal is enough in this case."
 dhe_museion.20.b:1 "The rarer the better, that is what the Mouseion is built to house."
 dhe_museion.20.c:0 "We can afford neither at the moment."
 dhe_museion.21.t:0 "Musing About Our Options"
 dhe_museion.21.desc:1 "We have some open positions at the Mouseion, and our academics have started searching for someone to fill the vacant rooms. They have come up with a couple of interesting options, and would like our take on the alternatives at hand."
 dhe_museion.21.a:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('random_character').GetName] seems like an interesting [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_character').GetWomanMan]."
 dhe_museion.21.b:0 "We have heard some good things about [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_character_2').GetName]."
 dhe_museion.21.c:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('random_character_3').GetName] could prove interesting."
 dhe_museion.21.d:1 "Neither would fit in at the Mouseion."
 dhe_museion.22.t:1 "Maintenace of the Mouseion"
 dhe_museion.22.desc:1 "Though building the Mouseion has been proven to be an undeniable boon to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], it has cost us a lot of money to keep everything working. The price of making sure the building is intact, and to take care of all the scrolls, texts and people working inside is noticeable as time passes."
 dhe_museion.22.a:0 "Expensive, these academics and artists."

Though the issues have been relatively minor so far, we fear it might just be the taste of what is to come.\n\n[SCOPE.sCharacter('random_advisor').GetName] recommend setting soldiers aside to guard the construction of the Colossus better.
