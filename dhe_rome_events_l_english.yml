 dhe_rome.1.t:0 "Legis Actiones"
 dhe_rome.1.desc_1:0 "The recent work of plebeian jurist Gnaeus Flavius, his Legis Actiones or Actions in Law, is the first written account of the legal procedures of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The importance of this work propelled him to the office of Tribune of the Plebs and garnered him wide populist support.\n\nThe full extent and interpretation of our laws has, until now, been a verbal tradition of our judiciary, and Flavius' attempt to codify parts of our legal procedures for a wider audience has not been wholly appreciated.\n\nSome patricians argue a public airing of our sacred laws, by a plebeian no less, threatens their traditional prerogative over government positions and the laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], while the populists welcome greater rights and participation for the plebs."
 dhe_rome.1.desc_2:0 "The recent work of deceased plebeian jurist Gnaeus Flavius, his Legis Actiones or Actions in Law, is the first written account of the legal procedures of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The importance of this work propelled him to the office of Tribune of the Plebs and garnered him wide populist support, a legacy which is now being celebrated by politicians like [SCOPE.sChar('dhe_rome_gnaeus_flavius_scope').GetName].\n\nThe full extent and interpretation of our laws has, until now, been a verbal tradition of our judiciary, and Flavius' attempt to codify parts of our legal procedures for a wider audience has not been wholly appreciated.\n\nSome patricians argue a public airing of our sacred laws, by a plebeian no less, threatens their traditional prerogative over government positions and the laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], while the populists welcome greater rights and participation for the plebs."
 dhe_rome.1.a:0 "Transparency can only benefit our legal system."
 dhe_rome.1.b:0 "We cannot undo the damage, but we can control it."
 dhe_rome.2.t:0 "Conflict of the Orders"
 dhe_rome.2.desc:0 "In spite of the rights granted to plebeians since the last Secession in 411, tension between the patrician and plebeian classes of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been growing lately, partly influenced by the work of Gnaeus Flavius, among others. None of our concessions have dampened the plebeians determination to secure political and legal equality.\n\nHowever, a new political class made up of both patricians and plebeians has been growing, incorporating the middle income families of the republic. We must decide whether to promote the expansion of this new Nobilitas as a middle ground, or give in to the populist's demands for reform."
 dhe_rome.2.a:0 "Perhaps encouraging this new 'middle-class' could be the solution."
 dhe_rome.2.b:0 "Only real reform will truly resolve the issue."
 dhe_rome.2.bt:0 "The plebeians will be upset if this #Y Integration Law#! is changed before the Conflict is resolved."
 dhe_rome.3.t:0 "Secession of the Plebs"
 dhe_rome.3.desc_1:0 "The political debate of the patricians and plebeians has once again escalated into a full blown Secession. It seems promoting the new middle-class, while satisfying some of the wealthy plebeians and encouraging social mobility, only ostracized the rest of the population further.\n\nThe city has ground to a halt with thousands of freemen leaving the city to occupy the hill of Janiculum across the Tiber. Their leaders are demanding legal and political equality to end the strike."
 dhe_rome.3.desc_2:0 "The political debate of the patricians and plebeians has once again escalated into a full blown Secession. Although prior governments passed the requested reforms, the plebeians claim that the revocation of the Lex Hortensia is a betrayal of the promises of the Senate and demand that the laws be reinstated immediately.\n\nThe city has ground to a halt with thousands of freemen leaving the city to occupy the hill of Janiculum across the Tiber. Their leaders are demanding legal and political equality to end the strike."
 dhe_rome.3.a:0 "What choice to do we have?"
 dhe_rome.3.b:0 "We must reinstate the promised concessions."
 dhe_rome.3.c:0 "They are outside the pomerium. Let us teach them a lesson."
 dhe_rome.4.t:0 "Expansion of the Tribes"
 dhe_rome.4.desc:0 "Since Romulus founded our great city, its citizens have been divided into the tribes. Originally it was an ethnic distinction but since the Republic was formed the tribes have been divisions of eligible citizens whose local consensus is submitted as a vote in the Tribal Assembly in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nThe number of tribes has fluctuated throughout our history, beginning with merely three, there are now over thirty, added or redrawn as our state has grown. New tribes are formed as our citizen population rises to better represent the opinions of the whole Republic.\n\nThere have lately been calls to create two more tribes, to be named Aniensis and Terentina, to ensure votes are fairly distributed."
 dhe_rome.4.a:1 "This should please the provinces."
 dhe_rome.4.b:1 "We have enough tribes."
 dhe_rome.5.t:0 "Expansion of the Tribes"
 dhe_rome.5.desc:0 "Today's tribes are much changed from the strict geographic constituencies of the past, now consisting of a vertical slice of citizens from any one of the provinces. Although there are only four tribes within the city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] itself, the rural tribes are a valuable source of political legitimacy and play an important role in organizing the bureaucracy of the state, from electing local magistrates to passing motions by the Tribunes of the Plebs.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown far beyond the borders of Latium, and with the large increase in population there are again calls to instantiate more tribes for the Republic. In response, the Senate is debating the commission of two further tribes, to be named Quirina and Velina respectively."
 dhe_rome.5.a:1 "Our system requires granularity."
 dhe_rome.5.b:1 "We have enough tribes..."
 dhe_rome.6.t:0 "Development of Roman Law"
 dhe_rome.6.desc:0 "Our legal system has grown substantially as it tries to keep pace with the needs of an expanding population and the evolving social structure of the state. As a result, specialist jurists, often plebeians, have become a social caste unto themselves who supplement the work of judges and magistrates.\n\nThe Legis Actiones has been supplemented by the Laws of the Twelve Tables, providing far greater transparency for plebeians, and a more simple and open interpretation of the law is emerging with the introduction of legal precedents, or case law, in determining sentences."
 dhe_rome.6.a:0 "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
 dhe_rome.7.t:0 "The Great Transformation"
 dhe_rome.7.desc:0 "The expansion of the state has lead to large parcels of private farmland becoming concentrated in enormous provincial estates known as Latifundia. These estates have a reputation for the extensive use of slaves as well as directing their production towards profit oriented export products rather than grain for the population.\n\nWhile these estates make us a great deal of money, the owners of smaller farms and some populist politicians who are beginning to feel marginalized by these enterprises have lobbied for the curtailment of the latifundia system."
 dhe_rome.7.a:0 "These developments suit our situation."
 dhe_rome.7.b:0 "The plebeians should be appeased."
 dhe_rome.8.t:0 "Increased Social Tensions"
 dhe_rome.8.desc:0 "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown, our once vitally important permanent allies in Italy, known as the Socii, have become increasingly less important. Their diminishing significance has not been lost on them, with the privileges and attention the Socii formerly received falling into decline.\n\nThey are particularly irritated by the what they see as the encroachment of our citizens into their lands, who they claim are settling unlawfully. Thus they accuse us of favoring newly conquered peoples and citizens while disenfranchising our old and loyal allies who are not classed as citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dhe_rome.8.a:0 "This will all blow over."
 dhe_rome.8.b:0 "We must not lose their support."
 dhe_rome.9.t:0 "[SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName] Attacks"
 dhe_rome.9.desc:0 "We have been attacked by the powerful trading empire of [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName]! Many predicted this would befall us eventually, but without assistance we have little chance of defeating the invaders.\n\nThe prevailing mood is that our only hope is send an envoy in supplication to [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName], a natural rival of [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName], begging them to intervene on our behalf."
 dhe_rome.9.a:0 "We must send for help."
 dhe_rome.9.at:0 "[SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName] will receive an envoy requesting assistance."
 dhe_rome.9.b:0 "The gods will protect us."
 dhe_rome.10.t:0 "[SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetName] Calls for Aid Against [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName]"
 dhe_rome.10.desc:1 "We have received an urgent envoy from the small state of [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetName]. [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetRuler.GetTitle] [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetRuler.GetName] is requesting our immediate assistance against [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName], who [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetRuler.GetSheHe] claims have treacherously invaded [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetRuler.GetHerHis] country.\n\nTheir envoy has spent many hours in supplication before the Senate, and passionately argued that if we let the cities of [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetName] fall, it will only be a matter of time before [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName] tries to invade and destroy [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName].\n\nGiven our conflicting interests with [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName] in the Mediterranean, and their continued policy of expansion, this could be an opportunity to escalate the situation in our favor. How should we respond?"
 dhe_rome.10.a:0 "[SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName] must be destroyed."
 dhe_rome.10.b:0 "We are not ready for war. Yet."
 dhe_rome.10.bt:0 "We will gain claims on Carthage."
 dhe_rome.10.c:0 "[SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_aid_caller').GetName]? Please..."
 dhe_rome.11.t:0 "The Roman Response"
 dhe_rome.11.desc_1:0 "Our envoy has returned from [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName] with the news that they have agreed to help us and have declared war on [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName]! We may yet be able to maintain our independence with Roman blood.\n\nLet us hope they do not dally..."
 dhe_rome.11.desc_2:0 "Our envoy has returned from [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName] with the news that they while they would like to help us, they cannot come to our aid at this time. The cowards said they were not ready for a war with [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_carthage_scope').GetName].\n\nLet us hope the gods are kind to us."
 dhe_rome.11.desc_3:0 "Our envoy has returned from [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName] with the news that they refused to help us! The cowards showed no interest in our plight.\n\nMay the gods treat them as kindly as they have treated us."
 dhe_rome.11.a:0 "Praise Mars!"
 dhe_rome.11.b:0 "We should never have put our faith in [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetAdjective] cowards..."
 dhe_rome.11.c:0 "We should never have put our faith in [SCOPE.sC('dhe_rome_rome_scope').GetName]..."
 dhe_rome.12.t:0 "Conflict of the Orders"
 dhe_rome.12.desc_1:0 "The fractious years of the Conflict of the Orders have finally been put behind us; the promised legal reforms of populist politicians successfully eased the main grievances of the plebeians, despite attempts by other parties to undo their work. By maintaining their legal rights we have satisfied the main grievances of the plebeians, removing their political incentive to revolt. While some patricians may doubt the course we chose, there is no doubt that the populists ensured stability."
 dhe_rome.12.desc_2:0 "The fractious years of the Conflict of the Orders have finally been put behind us; the promised legal reforms of populist politicians successfully eased the main grievances of the plebeians, removing their political incentive to revolt. While some patricians may doubt the course we chose, there is no doubt that the populists ensured stability."
 dhe_rome.12.desc_3:0 "The fractious years of the Conflict of the Orders have ended in disaster; the promised legal reforms of populist politicians were constantly rescinded, undermining their efforts to ease the main grievances of the plebeians. The failure to maintain their legal rights and political equality has reinvigorated the plebeians political incentive to revolt.\n\nThey have once again marched in Secession to the hill of Janiculum, this time bearing arms and organized by disgruntled defecting soldiers. They demand that the senate be dissolved and replaced with the plebeian assemblies of the city."
 dhe_rome.12.desc_4:0 "The fractious years of the Conflict of the Orders have finally been put behind us; the encouragement of an aspirational plebeian sub-class combined with greater political participation and equality before the law has satisfied the main grievances of the plebeians, removing their political incentive to revolt."
 dhe_rome.12.a:0 "They had better not ask for anything else."
 dhe_rome.12.at:0 "You can now freely change your #Y Integration Law#!."
 dhe_rome.12.b:0 "Why didn't we just let it lie..."
 dhe_rome.15.t:0 "Rapid Assembly"
 dhe_rome.15.desc:0 "After suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the numerous, and fiercely competent Carthaginian navy, our fleet has slunk back to port with many hands lost.\n\nAll however, is not as devastating as it may appear. Amongst the surviving Roman vessels, a lone Carthaginian quadrireme sits; captured after it strayed too close to the retreating navy. Upon inspection by our shipwrights, a startling discovery was made - the Carthaginians, in a feat of engineering ingenuity, have numbered each plank, rib, and oar that make up the vessel, rendering construction of such majestic warships a matter of almost arbitrary skill.\n\nAdopting such a practice could hugely increase our potential for fielding a vast navy, perhaps even rivaling that of the Phoenicians themselves?"
 dhe_rome.15.a:0 "The shipwrights will not be pleased - but the reputation of Rome is at stake."
 dhe_rome.15.b:0 "No. We must protect the ancient traditions."
 dhe_rome_15_a_tooltip:0 "Every owned #Y Port#! in the Magna Graecia, Italia, and Cisalpine Gaul regions will receive a #R +2#! Local Unrest modifier, for #Y 10#! years."

 claims_on_greece_region_tooltip:1 "Rome gains a claim on every territory in the region of #Y Greece#!."
 dhe_rome.16.t:0 "Cradle of Civilization"
 dhe_rome.16.desc:0 "The Greek poleis spawned an exodus of art, philosophy, and culture, which shaped the development of Rome since the early days of our existence.\n\nNow, with our hegemony stretching into the very heartlands of their past oppressors, the disparate city states of Greece cry out for an end to tyranny. It is our right - nay; our duty, to liberate the downtrodden people of the Greek peninsula, bringing them under the fair rule of Roman law."
 dhe_rome.16.a:0 "Roma Invicta!"
 dhe_rome.17.t:0 "Across the Adriatic"
 dhe_rome.17.desc:0 "For many long years, those in control of the Epirote lands have interfered in the region they call Magna Graecia. Now, with our territory beginning to overlap with their sphere of influence, it has become all too apparent that there is only one solution.\n\nIf we are ever to be free of their meddling, we must take to the sea, and claim their land in order to protect the fair citizens of so called 'Magna Graecia', who wish only to lead a peaceful existence under our rule."
 dhe_rome.17.a:0 "Our eyes are on the horizon."
 claims_on_epirus_area_tooltip:1 "Rome gains a claim on every territory in the areas of #Y Epirus#! and #Y Illyria Graeca#!."
 dhe_rome.18.t:0 "Macedonian Threat"
 dhe_rome.18.desc:0 "Our landfall in Greece has raised the eyebrows of many of the kingdoms and successors splintered from the ruination of Alexander's great empire.\n\nThe region of Macedonia, populated by the proud ancestors of Philippos and Alexander, poses a significant threat to Rome, and to the liberty of the numerous cities in our shared spheres of influence.\n\nThe gods themselves augur well for our continued involvement in Macedonia - we must put an end to any interference in our expansion."
 dhe_rome.18.a:0 "Macedonia shall be ours."
 dhe_rome.19.t:0 "The Eagle Falls"
 dhe_rome.19.desc:0 "The catastrophic battle of [SCOPE.sP('battle_location').GetName] shall forever go down in the annals of history. In a stunning display of cowardice, [SCOPE.sUnit('legion').GetName] broke on the very field of battle, abandoning their posts, comrades, and ultimately; honor.\n\nTo add to this dark day for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people, the standard of [SCOPE.sUnit('legion').GetName] was seen being triumphantly borne away by the [SCOPE.sC('antagonist').GetAdjective] barbarians. Even now, one of our proud eagles languishes in their capital of [SCOPE.sC('antagonist').GetCapital.GetName]."
 dhe_rome.19.a:0 "Horror! It must have been an ambush!"
 dhe_rome.19.b:0 "Find the one responsible for this outrage..."
 eagle_capture_banner_tooltip:0 "An Eagle has been captured! You must conquer the city of #Y [Scope.Province.GetName]#! in order to reclaim the eagle, and the honor of our people!"
 dhe_rome.23.t:0 "The Two Romes"
 dhe_rome.23.desc:0 "The divisive civil war in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has caused a vast rift in all aspects of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society. The magnitude of the betrayal that [SCOPE.sC('other_romans').GetRuler.GetName] wrought upon our great nation, has led to many speaking of the existence of two Romes; the rightful government to the west, and the illegitimate pretenders in the east.\n\nThis eponymous schism serves only to reinforce the severity of the conflict, and we must do all in our power to bring an end to this affair, before the vultures descend."
 dhe_rome.23.a:0 "Troubling."
 dhe_rome.23.b:0 "Make a speech to the loyal sons of the true Rome."
 claims_on_macedonia_region_tooltip:1 "Rome gains a claim on every territory in the region of #Y Macedonia#!."
 dhe_rome.22.t:1 "The Eagle of Rome"
 dhe_rome.22.desc:1 "After a victorious battle in [SCOPE.sP('battle_location').GetName], our troops have found one of the famous eagles of Rome and brought it home to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. These spoils of war will forever stand as a testament to our triumph over the Latins.\n\nWhen the Romans are informed about their loss, they will desperately do everything in their power to get the eagle back. After all, who could live with such shame?"
 dhe_rome.22.a:1 "A celebration is in order."
