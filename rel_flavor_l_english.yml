 rel_flavor_hellenic.1.desc:0 "A man some say is [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_medicine_god')] himself has been seen in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName]. Rumors says he brings back people from the brink of death, no matter the disease or injury they might have. Though the man is probably not a living god as some rumors suggests, there might be benefits to bringing him to court."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.1.a:0 "He will help take care of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.1.b:0 "We will convince him to continue roaming through our lands."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.1.c:0 "And yet we have no need for his services."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.2.t:0 "Mysterious Disappearance"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.2.desc:0 "One day the mysterious Asclepian Wiseman showed up in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName], and now he has just as suddenly disappeared. Though we searched the whole capital for him, he is nowhere to be found, and nobody has seen him leave. Maybe he was [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_medicine_god')] after all?"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.2.a:0 "But what if we get sick?"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.3.t:0 "Oracle of Delphi"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.3.desc:0 "The Oracle of Delphi has been the rise and fall of many legendary heroes. Ill tidings arrive from the Oracle with a messenger, bearing news of the bad times to come, unless [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is to get a new leader.\n\nThe nobles of our society start looking at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] with skeptical eyes, as the Oracle herself has said [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] is ill-befitting a leader. Maybe it is time to change our leadership?"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.3.a:0 "A large ceremony will be held to appease the gods."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.3.b:1 "We need to convince everyone that the Oracle is wrong."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.3.c:0 "Outdated superstitions."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.4.t:0 "Divine Response"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.4.desc:2 "The ceremony to appease the gods continued for several days, until finally we got the response we were hoping for. It seems [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_god_of_light')] has been appeased by our actions, and has intervened on the behalf of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], to make sure [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] will continue ruling in the light of the gods. "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.4.a:0 "Great news!"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.5.t:0 "Prophecies Continues"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.5.desc:0 "The gods are silent as the days continues. In the end, the priests brings us the ill news. It seems the gods have truly decided that there is no redemption for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. With these two blow-backs to our rule, it is only a matter of time before someone will topple our current leadership."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.5.a:0 "Damnations!"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.6.t:0 "Oracle of Delphi"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.6.desc:0 "A messenger has been sent by the Oracle of Delphi herself. Apparently [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_god_of_light')] has seen good times coming for our country, particularly under the leadership of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].\n\nIn a grand announcement we bring the news to our populace at large, spreading the good word."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.6.a:0 "A celebration is in order!"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.6.b:0 "We will thank the Oracle for her good news."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.7.t:0 "Bountiful Olives"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.7.desc:0 "Our men in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] woke up to find large massive olives unlike any ever seen before. The local priests declare it a blessing of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_wisdom_goddess')], some say it is even a show of preference to the rest of the world.\n\nOur [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetOffice.GetName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetName] suggests building a small shrine to celebrate the goddess, to thank her for the gifts she has given to us."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.7.a:0 "A shrine is a fitting gift to a goddess."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.7.b:0 "We are thankful for her blessing."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.8.t:0 "The Gods of War"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.8.desc:0 "Our [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetOffice.GetName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetName] have suggested an offering to one of the gods, to bless us in our ongoing war efforts. All the gods have their domains, and we should make sure we know what sort of benefits we are looking for in battle."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.8.a:0 "There is only one god of war, [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_war_god')]. "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.8.b:0 "Our armies will be prepared with the help of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_forge_god')]."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.8.c:0 "We need the guidance of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_wisdom_goddess')]. "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.8.d:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_sea_god')] will show us the way!"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.8.e:0 "We do not need the help of the gods."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.9.t:0 "The Roving Maenads"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.9.desc:0 "There has been sightings of what some call 'Maenads' in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName], others say they are nothing more than bandits and madmen.\n\nWe should be careful about attacking these men and women, as we could make ourselves unpopular among the god and his other followers. However, leaving them to continue their ravaging through our countryside will not be popular among our people."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.9.a:0 "The soldiers will put an end to these bandits."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.9.b:0 "A shrine to [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_wine_god')] will ease these sufferings. "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.9.c:0 "They will probably move on soon."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.10.t:0 "The Heraclean Path"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.10.desc:0 "[SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] has seen a huge influx of visitors lately, and a reputation for being one of the cities [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_hero_god')] passed through on his way to Eurystheus back from Erytheia. Though it is impossible to say if he truly passed through the city or not, the stories have flourished lately.\n\nThis is a prime opportunity to build upon the myth, to honor the Hero and increase the potential commerce in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName]. "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.10.a:0 "Let us make sure we make the most out of these myths."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.10.b:0 "We will hold a small festival in his honor."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.11.t:0 "The Epic Writer"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.11.desc:0 "A man approaches us with the request for a room and some help to write a grand tale for the ages.

 rel_flavor_hellenic.11.a:0 "We will make sure all his needs are fulfilled while he writes this epic."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.11.a.tt:0 "The writing begins..."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.11.b:0 "A room will be set aside for him."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.11.c:0 "We have no interest in his epic."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.11.c.tt:0 "We will send the writer away."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.12.t:0 "The Epic Struggle"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.12.desc:0 "After months of writing, the man we hired to write an epic seems to have fallen into some monetary issues. Not only does he owe people money, but he needs more money for his research as well.\n\nHe assures us that with a little bit of aid, everything will be finished in practically no time at all. Considering what little we have seen so far, it seems somewhat far-fetched."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.12.a:0 "Everything will be as he wishes."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.12.a.tt:0 "The writing continues..."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.12.b:0 "We can afford to support him a little bit more."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.12.c:0 "Enough! Out with the pesky leech!"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.13.t:0 "The Epic Finish"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.13.desc.a:0 "The grand tale of the Argonautica have been completed, with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] playing an important role in the tale of the hunt for the Golden Fleece. People from far and wide come to our lands, to hear the original tale of Jason and the Argonauts. Some people claim a new Homer has been born, while others lay the honor at our feet for supporting the arts."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.13.desc.b:0 "The grand epic has finally been completed, with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] playing an important role in the tale. The tale seems fairly popular at home, but it never reached far outside our own borders. Our own people look to our ruler [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] as a wise patron of the arts, for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] aid in the task. "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.13.desc.c:0 "The epic has finally been completed, with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] playing an important role in the tale. Not only did it not prove to be popular outside of our borders, but it became highly unpopular at home as well. Despite the help we gave the writer, he simply could not write a decent tale after all. Shortly after the failure became apparent, the man fled the court, not to be seen again."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.13.a:0 "Fantastic work."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.13.b:0 "We appreciate the work he did."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.13.c:0 "Is that it?"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.14.t:0 "Man of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_war_god')] "
 rel_flavor_hellenic.14.desc:0 "One of our soldiers has the reputation of a man blessed by the god of war himself, fighting with a frenzy unlike any other. Some of our other soldiers question why he has not been promoted after all his heroic deeds during war, while others treat him as some sort of demigod."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.14.a:0 "He will join our court."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.14.b:0 "An inspiring man for our soldiers to look up to."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.15.t:0 "Touched by [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_commerce_god')]"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.15.desc:0 "[SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] has seen a huge influx of traders and travelers from far and wide recently. One of our advisors jokingly suggests we must have been blessed by [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_commerce_god')] himself.\n\nIt might have been a joke, but paying our dues to the god might be a good idea nonetheless. It could only be a boost in long term business, right?"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.15.a:0 "We will be inspired by the god, and make the most out of this."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.15.b:0 "A thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_commerce_god')] is in order."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.16.t:0 "The Plague in [plague_city_scope.GetName]"
 rel_flavor_hellenic.16.desc:0 "We have received news from [plague_city_scope.GetName] that the city has been ravaged by a disease; a significant proportion of the inhabitants have fallen ill. They have asked our leaders in general, but also entreated [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] in particular, to send them some form of aid. Our advisors, jealously taken aback by the direct appeals to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPraenomen], have started mutterings, implying that [plague_city_scope.GetName] must have somehow offended the gods and deserve divine punishment."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.16.a:0 "They must have brought this suffering upon themselves."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.16.b:0 "We will call upon whoever we can to put an end to this plague."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.16.c:0 "A messenger will be sent to the healers of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_medicine_god')]."
 rel_flavor_hellenic.16.c.tt:0 "This option is available because we have to access to an #Y Asklepion#! or an #Y Asklepian Wiseman#!."

### Canaanite Flavor ### 
 rel_flavor_canaanite.1.t:0 "A Gift to Tyrus"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.1.desc:0 "For eons we have sent donations to the great temple of Melqart in Tyrus, as an honor to our ancestors and the god. Our [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetOffice.GetName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetName] claims some of our recent issues might stem from our lack of faith.\n\n[SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetSheHe|U|] has raised an issue that will surely not be forgotten by the rest of the court any time soon. As is tradition, maybe it is time to send another gift to Tyrus after all? "
 rel_flavor_canaanite.1.a:0 "A gift for Melqart is the least we can do."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.1.b:0 "We have nothing to send to Tyrus."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.2.t:0 "The Hellenic Melqart"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.2.desc:1 "We have recently had an influx of believers from [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetName] visit our [randomized_country_province.Custom('get_city_type_loc')] of [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName], as it is apparently part of their beliefs about the demigod Herakles and his travels. Many have started seeing the similarities between the Hellenic demigod and our own Melqart.\n\nLooking into this line of dialog might help us better understand our neighbors, and grow a closer friendship with them. "
 rel_flavor_canaanite.2.a:0 "He's just like Melqart!"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.2.b:0 "Preposterous and blasphemous."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.3.t:0 "The High God"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.3.desc:0 "Our [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetOffice.GetName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetName] claims our future is bleak unless we appease [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_harvest_god')], as [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetSheHe] has had terrible visions about things to come. [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetSheHe|U|] has set aside a cadre of male animals for sacrifice, as is custom, and is asking us for the funds for a massive ceremony.\n\nThough we have nothing more than [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetHerHis] word to go by, it is unquestionably a good idea to try to appease the god in one way or another."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.3.a:0 "We will do anything in our power to help [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetHerHim]."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.3.b:0 "A small ceremony to appease the god will be fitting."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.3.c:0 "Enough with your visions already!"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.4.t:0 "Fertility in Question"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.4.desc:1 "Lately our ruler's fertility has come into question at court, as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has no children to speak of as of yet. It is said [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_love_goddess')] can bless one with fertility if one is truly deserving of her favor. Setting aside some sacrifices for the goddess might be enough to convince her to give [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] the boost [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] needs to assuage the rumors."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.4.a:0 "That is a... tempting offer."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.4.b:0 "Preposterous! There is no such issue!"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.5.t:0 "A Memory of our Rule"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.5.desc:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is wildly popular among our populace, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] rule will be remembered for many generations to come. Several of our advisors have suggested putting up a stele as a permanent memory of the era of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], as an inspiration for descendants and future leaders. "
 rel_flavor_canaanite.5.a:0 "Sounds like a good idea."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.5.b:0 "Our rule will stand as a testament on its own."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.6.t:0 "The Syncretic Healer"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.6.desc:0 "Among the populace of [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName], there is a growing cult to the local god of Shadrafa. Supposedly a healing mystic who has been seen traveling through the lands with a scorpion in his hands.\n\nThough the god is somewhat foreign to the rest of our people, this could be a great opportunity to show favor to this specific local faith. "
 rel_flavor_canaanite.6.a:0 "A shrine in his honor is the least we can do."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.6.b:0 "Let them be subservient to this god on their own."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.7.t:0 "Sidonian Mystic"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.7.desc:0 "With our ruler [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] struck by illness, many expected the worst soon to happen. A mystic from the Temple of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_medicine_god')] appears at our doorstep all of a sudden, sent to heal our ill. Not long passes before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is returning to how [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] used to be before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] got ill, clear minded and ready to take on the tasks of rule.\n\nA donation to the Temple of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_medicine_god')] would probably be appreciated, though they never asked for any such compensation."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.7.a:0 "A donation is only right."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.7.b:0 "We are already pious enough."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.8.t:0 "Harvest of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_harvest_god')]"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.8.desc:1 "The territory of [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] has seen a huge surprising growth in their grain production this year. The yearly festival in honor of [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_harvest_god')] must have paid off, as he has clearly given this area his blessing. Our advisors wonder if it is better if we shared this bountiful blessing with the rest of our nation as well, all taking part in the gift."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.8.a:0 "The gifts were to the people of [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName], and it will stay there. "
 rel_flavor_canaanite.8.b:0 "He blessed all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.9.t:0 "Patron God"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.9.desc:0 "A new shrine is being built in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and the local priest has asked us to be the one to decide which god it will honor. All the gods play important roles in our daily lives, and it is important to make sure we know which god would fit this specific shrine."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.9.a:0 "We will give it to [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_commerce_god')]."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.9.b:0 "One above all, [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_sky_god')]."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.9.c:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_moon_goddess')] sounds like the better option."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.10.t:0 "Melqart in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName]"
 rel_flavor_canaanite.10.desc:0 "The people of [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] have long followed other faiths than our own, but it seems there has started growing a belief in Melqart and his ways in the city. Though it is somewhat different than our own beliefs in the god, this could be a great opportunity to close the gap between our national faith and the local one."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.10.a:0 "Melqart will bring them closer to us."
 rel_flavor_canaanite.10.b:0 "We have no interest in their faith."

 ### Druidic Flavor ###
 rel_flavor_druidic.1.t:0 "The Druidic Conflict"
 rel_flavor_druidic.1.desc:0 "Some of our druids in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] have gotten into a conflict with our neighbors in [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetName], a conflict based on the local beliefs of the tribes in [SCOPE.sP('randomized_country_province').GetName] and [SCOPE.sP('random_neighbor_province').GetName]. We have received a messenger from the druids asking for proper support in their conflicts against our neighbors, though that would put us at odds with the [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetAdjective]."
 rel_flavor_druidic.1.a:0 "Ours is a nation that sticks together."
 rel_flavor_druidic.1.b:0 "This is a matter of faith, not of politics between nations."
 rel_flavor_druidic.2.t:0 "Druids of War"
 rel_flavor_druidic.2.desc:0 "Though the druids of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] usually stay passive in the matters of war, we have received their outright support in our current war efforts against [SCOPE.sCountry('war_country').GetName]. If we so wish, we could have the druids either inspire our troops, or to galvanize our people to ready for war."
 rel_flavor_druidic.2.a:0 "Our troops could need the inspiration."
 rel_flavor_druidic.2.b:0 "The people need to be prepared."

These types of banishments can end up with a person being a complete social outcast.\n\nMaybe it is time to try and appease the druids and their caste, to get our ruler back in their good graces?"
 rel_flavor_druidic.3.a:0 "Time to alleviate this situation."
 rel_flavor_druidic.3.b:0 "We WILL be accepted at the religious gatherings in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 rel_flavor_druidic.4.desc:0 "Several of the druids in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has foreseen the terrible rule and future of [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_character').GetName]. Supposedly [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_character').GetSheHe] will end the great era for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and bring our nation to ruination.\n\nAll our druids advise and demand that we find a new successor, before [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_character').GetName] puts an end to us. We need to decide if we should stand by [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_character').GetHerHim], or start looking for a new successor."

Our [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetOffice.GetName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetName] seems to have taken a particular dislike to the girl, often and viciously mocking her person and ways around court.\n\nSome suggest removing the girl quietly, whereas others would like to give her more space to show her ideas and affect our religion. Maybe we could both get rid of [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetName] and become more favorable among this girl's followers at once?"
 rel_flavor_druidic.5.a:0 "Yes, let us replace our [SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetOffice.GetName]."

 rel_flavor_druidic.12.desc:0 "Lately some of our leaders have started to take advantage of the druids and their role in society, even going as far as to expect them to contribute monetarily to the nation. They are the pride and center of our faith, and it is clear this is a taxing situation for them.\n\n[SCOPE.sCharacter('randomized_priest').GetName] is speaking for the druids and demand an end to this abuse of power.
